# mystery word

##Tests:

mystery_word_test.py tests many of the testable functions in mystery_word.py I don't know how to test many of the functions because they require user input and I don't know how to mock that yet. All the tests pass.

##mystery_word.py
The computer plays a word game with the user, utilizing /usr/share/dict/words on nearly every unix-like system


# evil mystery word
##Tests:
Several more tests were written for the evil version of the mystery word game. One currently fails.

##evil_mystery_word.py
The computer is supposed to play a word game with the user, selecting a variety of words that conform to the user's guesses. Therefore the game is harder to beat, because the computer discards words that validate the user's guess. This implementation is broken.
